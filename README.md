# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub.

Hey all,

My name is Daniel here and I am trying to learn how to use GitHub.
I don't know anything about repositories, branches, or commits or anything like that yet.
Please be kind to me. I would like to one day make my own programs that solve real world problems
and tackle crisis such as climate change, transparency, and all the other cool things we need.
